# Farm→Market Optimizer

A Streamlit-based tool for planning delivery routes from farms to local markets using simple route optimization techniques.

This project lives in my **private development repo**, where it includes:
- A Streamlit web app
- A nearest-neighbor VRP-style route solver
- Distance and ETA calculations
- Basic CO₂ estimation
- Sample farmer/market data

This page summarizes the project results, visuals, and outcomes.

## What this project solves
Small farmers often struggle with planning efficient routes to multiple weekly markets.  
This tool:
- Helps them minimize miles driven
- Reduces delivery time
- Simplifies planning into a clear route table + map

## Architecture Overview
- ESP32 / sensor data (optional future phase)
- Route solver module
- Streamlit interface
- Optional connection to PostgreSQL for saved routes
