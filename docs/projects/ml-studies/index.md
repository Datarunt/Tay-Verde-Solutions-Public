# ML Studies

This section highlights my machine learning research, experiments, and exploratory notebooks that support my applied projects (Delivery Forecasting, Mold Risk Prediction, Farm Route Optimization, and more).

These studies live in my **private development repo** and include:
- Regression benchmarking (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Classification experiments (precision vs recall, F1 scoring, ROC)
- Error metric comparisons (RMSE vs MAE vs MBE)
- Feature engineering prototypes
- Time-series forecasting experiments
- Data cleaning and EDA workflows

## Topics Included

### 1. Regression Models
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge / Lasso  
- Random Forest Regressors  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost  
- Model tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV  
- Error analysis: RMSE, MAE, MBE, R²  

### 2. Classification
- Feature cleaning and imputation  
- Overfitting / underfitting checks  
- Precision vs Recall tradeoff  
- Confusion Matrix interpretation  
- F1 score optimization  

### 3. Time Series Experiments
- Rolling averages  
- Lag features  
- Simple forecasting baselines  
- Comparison to tree-based methods  

### 4. EDA Notebook Patterns
- Cleaning workflows  
- Correlation mapping  
- Outlier detection  
- Trend and seasonality inspection  

## Why This Matters
These studies form the foundation for my applied analytics work, including:
- Mold Risk Prediction (microgreens)  
- Farm Route Optimization  
- Inventory Forecasting & Delivery Assurance  

## Code Availability
These studies live in my private repo as ongoing work.  
I can provide walkthroughs or excerpts on request.
