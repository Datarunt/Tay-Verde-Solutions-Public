# ML Studies

This section highlights my machine learning research, experiments, and exploratory notebooks that support my applied projects (Delivery Forecasting, Mold Risk Prediction, Farm Route Optimization, and more).

These studies live in my **private development repo** and include:
- Regression benchmarking (Linear Regression, etc)
- Error metric comparisons (RMSE vs MAE vs MBE)
- Feature engineering prototypes
- Time-series forecasting experiments
- Data cleaning and EDA workflows

## Topics Included

### 1. Regression Models
- Naive
- Moving Average
- Basic Linear Regression  
- Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA
- Prophet
- Error analysis: RMSE, MAE, MBE 

### 2. Time Series Experiments
- Rolling averages  
- Lag features  
- Simple forecasting baselines  

### 3. EDA Notebook Patterns
- Data cleaning
- Correlation mapping
- Outlier detection
- Trend and seasonality inspection
- Quick prototype visualizations

## Why This Matters
These studies form the foundation for my applied analytics work, including:
- Farm Route Optimization: Model insights feed into cost estimation, service-level prediction, and future enhancements like “model-based ETA per stop” and “vehicle performance modeling.”
- Delivery Forecasting: Understanding baseline models, tuning methods, and feature engineering helps improve ETA prediction quality in logistics systems.

## Machine Learning Use Cases in Logistics

- **Smarter Demand Forecasting**  
  Machine learning models can predict order volumes, inventory needs, and labor requirements with greater accuracy, reducing shortages and excess inventory.

- **Optimized Routing and Network Planning**  
  Algorithms can generate efficient delivery routes and load plans in real time, lowering transportation costs and improving delivery reliability.

- **Predictive Asset Maintenance**  
  Machine learning can unconver early indicators of equipment or fleet failure, minimizing downtime and increasing overall operational resilience.

- **Intelligent Warehouse Automation**  
  Machine learning optimizes picking strategies, predicts optimal slotting, flags anomalies in order flow, and coordinates automated systems to improve accuracy and accelerate fulfillment.

## Code Availability
These studies live in my private repo as ongoing work.  
I can provide walkthroughs or excerpts on request.
