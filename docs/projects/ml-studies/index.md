# ML Studies

This section highlights my machine learning research, experiments, and exploratory notebooks that support my applied projects (Delivery Forecasting, Mold Risk Prediction, Farm Route Optimization, and more).

These studies live in my **private development repo** and include:
- Regression benchmarking (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Error metric comparisons (RMSE vs MAE vs MBE)
- Feature engineering prototypes
- Time-series forecasting experiments
- Data cleaning and EDA workflows

## Topics Included

### 1. Regression Models
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge / Lasso  
- Random Forest Regressors  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost  
- Model tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV  
- Error analysis: RMSE, MAE, MBE, R²  

### 2. Time Series Experiments
- Rolling averages  
- Lag features  
- Simple forecasting baselines  
- Comparison to tree-based methods  

### 3. EDA Notebook Patterns
- Data cleaning
- Correlation mapping
- Outlier detection
- Trend and seasonality inspection
- Quick prototype visualizations

## Why This Matters
These studies form the foundation for my applied analytics work, including:
- Farm Route Optimization: Model insights feed into cost estimation, service-level prediction, and future enhancements like “model-based ETA per stop” and “vehicle performance modeling.”
- Delivery Forecasting: Understanding baseline models, tuning methods, and feature engineering helps improve ETA prediction quality in logistics systems. 

## Code Availability
These studies live in my private repo as ongoing work.  
I can provide walkthroughs or excerpts on request.
