**Data Engineer & Analytics Professional** specializing in:

- Machine learning for forecasting & delivery reliability  
- Data engineering pipelines (Python, SQL, Streamlit, OR-Tools)  
- Supply chain analytics & decision-support systems  

I use applied ML + optimization to solve real-world problems in **agriculture**,  
**supply chain**, and **small-scale logistics**. I also study IoT environmental monitoring (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors) on the side.

# Featured Projects

## **Weekly Delivery & Routing Analytics Pipeline**  
**Python · APIs · Pandas · GitHub Actions · Data Engineering**  
A weekly-updating data pipeline that ingests public traffic and weather data to generate delivery-ready features for routing, ETA prediction, and congestion analysis.  
Feeds the **Farm Market Optimizer (FMO)** app and **ML Studies** section with real-world signals (distance, delay, speed factors) to support forecasting, feature engineering, and model selection.

## **Machine Learning Studies (MLS)**  
**EDA · Regression · Classification · ML Pipelines**  
My personal ML sandbox where I explore delivery forecasting, delay-risk modeling,  
and feature engineering—using lessons learned from real supply chain scenarios.

## **Farm Market Optimizer (FMO)**  
**Python · OR-Tools · Streamlit · Route Optimization**  
A lightweight routing and logistics engine designed for small farms and local food networks.  
Features VRP optimization, basic ETA modeling, and an interactive Streamlit app.
