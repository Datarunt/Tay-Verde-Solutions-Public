**Data Engineer & Analytics Professional** specializing in:

- Machine learning for forecasting & delivery reliability  
- Data engineering pipelines (Python, SQL, Streamlit, OR-Tools)  
- Supply chain analytics & decision-support systems  

I use applied ML + optimization to solve real-world problems in **agriculture**,  
**supply chain**, and **small-scale logistics**. I also study IoT environmental monitoring (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors) on the side.
